# coffee_analysis
An analysis of the Sales and Profits of Coffee. I embarked on an Excel journey of analyzing the coffee dataset I acquired from Kaggle. To try to figure out insights on the Sales and profit from the data and determine how useful it can be.
I begun by importing the data into power query in excel. This gives an overview just like Power BI that allowed me to transfomr my data by trimming the spaces before and efter the entries in the cells. Then I had to normalize my Date column into a Datetime data type for easy analysis.


# 1. A SNIP OF THE DATASET

The dataset contains a shape of 1063 rows and 26 columns, factoring in my additional columns after transformation.

The main KPIs I wanted to visualize are the actual versus target sales, cost of goods sold (COGS), profit, and expenses.


# 4. Sales and Inventory Charts
This is a sheet that contains all the pivot tables created concerning Sales alone. The analysis was done on the Market, Market Size, Product, Product type, Product Line, State, Monthly sales, Sales according to Geography, and their respective visualizations. The slices are added to show the breakdown as per the Market, and the Periods, i.e, Months, quarters, and Years.
